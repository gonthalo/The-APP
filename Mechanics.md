# The beggining
The user shall name several of his/her goals, and some activities that he could use to archieve each goal.
Then, each activity is given a numerical value based in the concept of its utility, and the same goes for the goals.
This numerical value may either be set by the user, or by The APP, using an exponential fitting.

# The next step
When the user's priorities are set, the APP starts displaying how the user is doing.
For each goal, The APP displays a bar of utility and a number indicating the "level" of that goal. In order to level up, the user must increase the utility of the goal by doing activities, and if the end of the bar is reached, the level of that activitie increases by one. The amount of utility required to level up of a given level should be O(level), so that the utility required to reach it is O(level^2).
The user should input The APP the name of an activity each time it is done in the real life.
